# Task_Manager
This is a project which creates a task managing application using python

This was created as a productivity tool so as to take of the strain of decision making.
One can add tasks along with their priority on a scale of 1 to 10.
The app then generates a random task from it based on the priority.
Thus we can do that task without having to think of which task we are supposed to do.

There are definitly many improvements that can be made.
